This project is my approach to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The overall goal is to gain an understanding of the various aspects of UAVs like microcontrollers, simulators and remote controlled model airplanes. Therefore I needed an environment where most of these aspects can be simulated and explored. The evolving result is what I call the UAV Playground.<br>
<br>
<strong>Features</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Software architecture for interconnecting components through messaging
  <li>GUI independent support for the implementation of visual components
  <li>Specific GUI elements for the Processing Development Environment (e.g. joystick, servo, slider, graph)
  <li>Connection to the FlightGear Flight Simulator to control the simulator and receive its data
  <li>Very simple autopilot that uses a PID controller for elevator and aileron
  <li>Modular, intuitive and easy to use
</ul>

<strong>Basis</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Java
  <li>Processing Development Environment or eclipse
  <li>FlightGear Flight Simulator
</ul>

The UAV Playground is a work in progress and will be extended as I work on the exploration of UAVs.<br>
