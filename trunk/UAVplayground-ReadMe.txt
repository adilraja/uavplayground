UAV Playground
==============

This is my approach to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The overall goal is to
gain an understanding of the various aspects of UAVs like microcontrollers,
simulators and remote controlled model airplanes. Therefore I needed an
environment where most of these aspects can be simulated and explored. The
evolving result is what I call the UAV Playground.

Feel free to try it out and use it or part of it in your own projects. I'd
appreciate if you leave me a message if you are using UAV Playground or parts
of the source code.
