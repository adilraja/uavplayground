UAV Playground
==============

Prerequisite
------------
- Java JRE or JDK (http://java.sun.com/javase/)
- Processing Development Environment (PDE) [optional] (http://www.processing.org)
- FlightGear Flight Simulator (FG) [optional] (http://www.flightgear.org)
- Google Earth [optional] (http://earth.google.com/)

If you want to play around with the UAV Playground
--------------------------------------------------
- Copy all the FlightGear files from the distribution to the location where you
  installed FlightGear
- Copy all the Processing files from the distribution to the location where you
  installed the PDE
- Start Processing and choose File->Sketchbook->UAVplayground to open an example
  application
- Follow the instructions in the examples
  
If you want to run UAVsim as a standalone application
-----------------------------------------------------
- Copy all the FlightGear files from the distribution to the location where you
  installed FlightGear
- Run the UAVsim.jar Java application (double click or via the console)
- Run FlightGear with the Start-FlightGear-UAVsim.bat batch file (edit if
  necessary)
- [Run Google Earth by double-clicking the Start-GoogleEarth-Tracking.kml file
  or just open the file in Google Earth] (optional)
  
About the UAV Playground
------------------------
This is my approach to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The overall goal is to
gain an understanding of the various aspects of UAVs like microcontrollers,
simulators and remote controlled model airplanes. Therefore I needed an
environment where most of these aspects can be simulated and explored. The
evolving result is what I call the UAV Playground.

Feel free to try it out and use it or part of it in your own projects. I'd
appreciate if you leave me a message if you are using UAV Playground or parts
of the source code.
